  },{
   "00009C45;0000006F": "\"I boiled some vegetables. It's tasty because all the vegetables are melted. It's red because of the tomatoes.\""
  },{

  },{
   "00009D19;0000003A": "\"It looks simple, but a lot of time was put into it, huh?\""
  },{
   "00009D74;00000037": "\"It seems all the cuisines I know are based on stew...\""
  },{
   "00009DCB;00000049": "\"Oh... this is really good. Will you teach me how to make this sometime?\""

  },{
   "0000A1DD;00000024": "\"I think I had lots of boiled food.\""
  },{
   "0000A221;00000009": "\"Boiled?\""
  },{
   "0000A24B;00000023": "\"Yes, like vegetable soup, stew...\""
  },{
   "0000A28E;00000049": "\"It sounds like it's troublesome to make. Were you making them yourself?\""
  },{
   "0000A2F8;0000003F": "\"I don't know. I do somehow remember how to cook them, though.\""
  },{
   "0000A357;0000003A": "\"Oh, then will you teach me how? I want to try making it.\""
  },{
   "0000A3B2;0000001B": "\"Oh, it'll be my pleasure.\""

   "0000A4C4;00000007": "\"Okay.\""
  },{
   "0000A4EA;00000033": "\"Talk after your mouth is empty. So... what is it?\""
  },{
   "0000A53D;0000001C": "\"Um... you don't cook, Aoi?\""
  },{
   "0000A578;0000001E": "\"W-Well... I can cook, but...\""
  },{
   "0000A5B6;00000034": "\"Kit... the food she makes are too plain and light.\""
  },{
   "0000A60A;00000009": "\"Really?\""
  },{
   "0000A632;00000046": "\"Please call it light vegetarian cuisine. It is good for your health.\""
  },{
   "0000A698;0000002D": "\"But I don't think it'll be enough for me...\""
  },{
   "0000A6E5;0000002B": "\"Yup. That's exactly what I wanted to say.\""
  },{
   "0000A730;0000005A": "\"Well, we have an excellent cook called Me-chan now, so Aoi doesn't need to cook anymore.\""
  },{
   "0000A7A8;00000063": "\"...I believe my meals are better than the end of the century meals. At least my meals are edible.\""
  },{
   "0000A82B;00000014": "\"What did you say!?\""
  },{
   "0000A85F;00000017": "\"Hey now. Don't fight.\""

  },{
   "0000AACB;0000002D": "\"That's rare. Did you screw up or something?\""

   "0000AB17;00000020": "\"I was too busy to go shopping.\""
  },{
   "0000AB56;00000027": "\"We don't have much in stock either...\""
  },{
   "0000AB9C;0000003A": "\"Well, I think it will be good to go out once in a while.\""
  },{
   "0000ABF6;00000039": "\"Yeah. To be honest, she's been inviting us to go there.\""
  },{
   "0000AC4F;00000018": "\"Yay! We're eating out!\""
  },{
   "0000AC88;0000001E": "\"Then I will be waiting here.\""

   "0000ACC6;0000001A": "\"Oh, you should come too.\""
  },{
   "0000ACFE;0000004D": "\"Please do not be absurd. They will kick us out if we bring a ghost with us.\""
  },{

  },{
   "0000ADA4;0000003C": "\"There's nothing I can eat even if I go, so I'll wait here.\""
